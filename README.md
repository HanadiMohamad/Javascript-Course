# Javascript-Course

This Repo showcases the skills I developed during the Javascript-Course course. It includes interactive projects such as a Tic Tac Toe game, a calculator, and a pizza menu â€” all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Skills Gained
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive and styled layouts with CSS
- Interactive features using JavaScript (DOM manipulation, events, logic)
- Debugging and problem-solving in small web applications

## Why It Matters
JavaScript plays a key role in front-end development and is essential for learning popular frameworks like React and Vue.js. This course gave me the tools to start building real, dynamic websites and continue growing as a developer.

## Personal Reflection
What I enjoyed most was seeing my code come to life and building fully functional apps from scratch. The hands-on projects helped me retain core concepts and boosted my confidence as a developer.
